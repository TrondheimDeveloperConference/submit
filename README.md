# What is this?

This is an application that lets speakers submit talks to JavaZone.

Integrates with [Sleepingpill](https://github.com/javaBin/sleepingPillCore) which stores the talks.

# Getting started

* Check out repo: `git clone git@github.com:javaBin/submit.git`
* Build backend: `cd backend && mvn clean install`
* Build frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
* Run the app: `./scripts/start.sh`

This starts a screen. To escape from the screen: `ctrl-x`, `q`, `y`.
